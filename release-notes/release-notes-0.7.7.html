<h3>Changelog</h3>
<p>A new option to disable macOS' autosave was added to the general preferences. There should be no need to disable this feature since it helps to prevent data loss in various situations but if you need or want full control on when MacPass saves to a file you now are able to disable autosave. Disabling this also disables support of file versioning, version browsing and restoration.</p>
