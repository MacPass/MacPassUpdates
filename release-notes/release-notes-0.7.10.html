<h3>Changelog</h3>

This update contains various changes to make MacPass work on macOS 10.15 Catalina.

<h4>Known Issue</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Databases located on network drives or external storage might not get saved with an error message. A possible workaround is to open the file via the Finder, which should allow MacPass to write to those locations. A future update of MacPass will fix this issue</li>
