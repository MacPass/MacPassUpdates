<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>Version 0.4 and 0.4.1 have introduced a bug that stores Auto-type keystroke sequences even if they are inherited.
Additionally the default sequence wasn&#8217;t the usual <code>{USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}</code> but the rather bad <code>{TAB}{USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}</code>.
Please take the time to look at your entries and remove the Auto-type sequences. Additionally there&#8217;s a helper you can use via Edit > Fix Autotype… that lets	you strip all auto-type sequences.</p>
<h3 id="upcoming">Upcoming</h3>
<ul>
<li>0.5.x will be the last version to run on 10.8.</li>
<li>0.6 is going to require 10.9 and will include KeePassHttp support.</li>
<li>The editing system will be changed to work more to the Keepass standard. That is, undo is based on history entries. This kills some of the nicer features of a full undo/redo system but should make a huge step towards interoperability</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="noteworthy_changes">Noteworthy Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Resolved issues with wrong Auto-type sequences</li>
<li>Added Auto-type fix dialog that helps drill down on malformed databases</li>
<li>Enabled Autotype. The feature is not fully working but simple (default) scenarios should work.</li>
<li>Added password duplicates and expired entries to search filters.</li>
<li>Added Quick-look preview. This creates a temporary file and thus is considered harmful. The file gets removed by MacPass but in case of a crash the files might stay there until OS X cleans the temporary folders</li>
<li>MacPass now comes with document icons</li>
<li>MacPass now tries to open any file regardless of file extension (this works only in the open dialog!)</li>
</ul>
